# Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) JSON Schema Visualizer

The OASIS CSAF Technical Committee is chartered to make a major revision to the Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (CVRF) under a new name for the framework that reflects the primary purpose: a Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF). TC deliverables are designed to standardize existing practice in structured machine-readable vulnerability-related advisories and further refine those standards over time.

Anyone wishing to contribute to this GitHub project and participate in the TC's technical activity is invited to join as an OASIS TC Member. Public feedback is also accepted, subject to the terms of the OASIS Feedback License. [How to Join a Committee](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/join).
